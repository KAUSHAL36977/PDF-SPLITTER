# PDF Splitter in C++  

## Overview  
This project is a **PDF Splitter** tool written in **C++**, designed to split a PDF file into individual pages or custom page ranges. It utilizes a PDF library, such as **Poppler** or **PDFium**, to handle the splitting and manipulation of PDF files efficiently.

## Features  
- Split a PDF into individual pages.  
- Extract specific page ranges into separate files.  
- Handle PDFs with different layouts and sizes.  
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, Windows, macOS).  

## Prerequisites  
To build and run the project, ensure you have the following installed:  
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).  
- **CMake** (optional, for build configuration).  
- A PDF library such as **Poppler** or **PDFium** (ensure the library is installed and linked properly).  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/username/pdf-splitter.git  
   cd pdf-splitter  
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   - For **Poppler**:  
     ```bash  
     sudo apt install libpoppler-dev   # Linux  
     ```  
     Refer to the Poppler installation guide for other platforms.  

3. Build the project:  
   ```bash  
   mkdir build  
   cd build  
   cmake ..  
   make  
   ```  

## Usage  
Run the executable with the following options:  
```bash  
./pdf_splitter input.pdf -o output_directory [options]  
```  

### Options:  
- `-s` or `--split`: Split the PDF into individual pages.  
- `-r <start-end>` or `--range <start-end>`: Extract a specific range of pages.  
- `-h` or `--help`: Display usage information.  

### Examples:  
1. Split a PDF into individual pages:  
   ```bash  
   ./pdf_splitter example.pdf -o output_pages/ -s  
   ```  

2. Extract pages 3 to 7:  
   ```bash  
   ./pdf_splitter example.pdf -o output_pages/ -r 3-7  
   ```
